XCT is a principle, not a product.

We welcome:

We do NOT accept:
- Changes that introduce model autonomy
- Implicit execution or retries
- Hidden state inside the model

## How to contribute

2. Create a focused branch
3. Open a PR with a clear description

## Issues

Use issues for:
- Spec questions
- Design discussion
- Bug reports in reference implementations
