# XCT Philosophy

Autonomy is not responsibility.

Execution is the point of no return in any system.
Once state is mutated, recovery becomes expensive or impossible.

XCT is based on a simple idea:
decision is cheap, execution is expensive.

Models may decide.
Systems must control.
Tools execute.

Errors are not failures.
They are signals.

Reliable systems are defined not by what they can do,
but by what they refuse to do.
